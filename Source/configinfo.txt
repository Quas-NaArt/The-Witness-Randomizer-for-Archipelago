FullGaps: Gaps go all the way between two vertices instead of part of the way.
StartEdgeOnly: Starts will only be placed on the edges of the puzzle.
DisableWrite: Don't write the puzzle out to the game's memory immediately. This allows for changes to be made after generation. write() must be called manually afterwards
PreserveStructure: Keep the same arrangement of vertices and edges that the original puzzle had. Without this, the puzzle will be expanded to a grid.
MakeStonesUnsolvable: Make sure a stone puzzle is unsolvable. Used for some of the eraser puzzles
SmallShapes: Smaller tetris shapes than normal, with an average size of about 2-3 blocks
DisconnectShapes: Tetris shapes may be discontiguous
ResetColors: Force the default symbol color scheme
DisableCancelShapes: Don't make solutions where positive/negative shapes cancel
RequireCancelShapes: Make only solutions where positive/negative shapes cancel
BigShapes: Bigger tetris shapes than normal, with an average size of about 5-6 blocks
SplitShapes: Don't make solutions where tetris shapes combine
RequireCombineShapes: Make only solutions where tetris shapes combine
TreehouseLayout: Position starts and exits in the middle, like in the Treehouse
TreehouseColors: Use a color scheme that gives a proper looking orange and green for triangles.
AlternateColors: Use an alternate symbol color scheme. The colors used vary by puzzle
WriteColors: Write out exact colors from each symbol. Sometimes needed to get a proper red, orange, or green. Unfortunately it doesn't apply to triangles
Write2Color: Write out line and dot colors for a blue/yellow symmetry puzzle
FixBackground: Fix the background area to match the puzzle shape. For puzzles with irregular background areas being turned into rectangular
WriteSpecular: Write the green channel into the specular texture
LongPath: Make a longer than usual path, covering at least 7/8 of the available points
ShortPath: Make a path without any length restrictions
EnableFlash: Turn on symbol flashing for the panel
DecorationsOnly: Write out only the puzzle symbols to memory, preserving the original point and edge locations
FalseParity: Cause a full path to miss one vertex. For eraser + full dot puzzles
DisableDotIntersection: Dots will not be put on grid intersections
WriteDotColor: Make dots a dark grey color
WriteDotColor2: Make dots the same color as the line
LongestPath: Make the longest path possible, covering every point. For full dot puzzles
WriteInvisible: Make the symmetry path invisible
DisableReset: Write the puzzle out, but don't flush the puzzle data. Allows for reusing data for the next puzzle
MountainFloorH: Only for the mountain floor puzzles on hard mode
